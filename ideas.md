 * monster special rules *
 Slow: Strikes last
 
 Energy Drain: If players take wounds from this creature, their max hand size is reduced by 1 for the next draw step.
 Aggressive(X): If a player ends his turn within X spaces, attack that player. If the monster is out of range, or has no range, move the monster
	within range and adjacent to that player by the shortest route. In case of multiple routes, the victimized player chooses.
 Range(X): The monster can attack and defend any player within X spaces of it. The monster will only attack i aggresive.
 Tough: When the monster dies, return it to the board in the same location. The monster must be killed again to remove it.
	It offers no reward for the first kill.
 Resistance(X): When a player attacks a resistant monster, remove a card of the chosen type providing the least bonus damage before calculating total power.
	You must remove a card which deals damage in this way if possible. If two cards are tied, the player chooses.
 Immunity(X): The monster takes no damage from the indicated damage type.
 
 
**ranged damage**
*how it works*
Spells and weapons can have a range stat.
If using spells and weapons with range, that spell or weapon can attack a monster if up to that distance away.
Any outstanding damage must be dealt at the next closest range.
Thus it is all or nothing with range.

**the turn**
- Either go to town (townportal spell):
1) Discard cards to gain their value as buying power
2) Buy a single card from the shop line
3) Replenish shop line
OR
- explore the dungeon:
1) <repeat as desired>
1a) Play cards
1b) Attack Monsters
2) Discard unwanted cards (cannot discard wounds)
3) Refill hand

*Card actions*
1) Can be discarded to equipment
2) Can be discarded to gain 1 movement
3) Can be played for its effect
3.1) Cards played for effect accumulate damage done
3.2) When attacking a monster, that monster takes all accumulated dammage
3.3) All cards spent in an attack is discarded
3.4) Any cards hitting multiple monsters are not discarded when attacking a monster
3.5) Any effects of cards are resolved before accumulating attack power

**Movement and exploration**
*movement*
1 Movement point allows a player to either
a) move a single space vertically, horizontally or diagonally
b) move to the closest edge of a neighbouring tile IFF
b.1) the player's current tile is currently free of monsters
b.2) the target tile is currently free of monsters

*exploration*
A player at the unexplored edge of a tile, may spend 1 movement point to draw the top-most tile from the tile stack
Such a tile must
1) Be placed adjacent to the edge the player is currently exploring
1.a) If the player is at a corner, both sides can be explored
1.b) This decission is made after looking at the tile
2) Place the tile in a way that aligns the two tiles
2.a) if possible the player must place a non-wall space next to himself
A player may not explore an edge, if there is a wall between him and the edge.

**Fight**
A player may fight a monster if they have enough damage on hand to kill the monster.
The monster is removed, and the player puts X wound cards into his hand, where X is the monster's dammage score.
Players may use spells and effects to cancel wounds gained.
If either side is faster than the other, the slower actor takes dammage first. If lethal to a monster is dealt this way, the player is unharmed.
